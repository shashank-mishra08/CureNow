## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

*   `admin/`: Contains the React.js frontend application for the administrator panel.
*   `backend/`: Houses the Node.js/Express.js backend API.
*   `frontend/`: Contains the React.js frontend application for the user-facing portal.

## API Endpoints

The backend API is structured with clear routes for user, doctor, and admin functionalities.
